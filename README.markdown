# Terasology Maze module

This little module allows you to build mazes of any size.

The player is given a special item to designate the area, where the maze should be placed. It must have a size of 6x6x1 blocks at least.
Having multiple block in height (y) will build 2 blocks maze and 1 block floor for the next maze level. No ladders or stairs are build into
the maze yet.
